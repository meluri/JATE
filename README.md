# J.A.T.E (Just Another Text Editor)

This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) called **Just Another Text Editor (J.A.T.E.)**. It utilizes `IndexedDB` to store and retrieve content, ensuring that your text editor data is available even when offline. The app can be installed as a standalone application via a browser's install prompt.

## Features

- **IndexedDB** support for saving and retrieving text content.
- **CodeMirror** integration for a rich text editing experience, with syntax highlighting for JavaScript.
- **Service Worker** setup using Workbox for offline capability.
- **Installable PWA** functionality so users can install the app to their desktop or mobile devices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone 
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd jate
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. Start the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Usage

1. **Text Editor**: The app provides a basic text editor where you can input JavaScript code or plain text.
2. **Save Content**: Content is automatically saved to `IndexedDB` whenever the editor loses focus.
3. **Retrieve Content**: The app retrieves previously saved content from `IndexedDB` when it is reloaded, ensuring persistence between sessions.
4. **PWA Installation**: You can install the app on your device using the browser's install prompt by clicking the "Install" button that appears when you run the app.

## Code Structure

- **`src/js/editor.js`**: Manages the CodeMirror text editor and handles content persistence.
- **`src/js/database.js`**: Implements methods to interact with `IndexedDB` to store and retrieve content.
- **`src-sw.js`**: Defines the service worker logic using Workbox for caching assets and enabling offline access.

## API Methods

### `putDb(content)`

- **Description**: Adds content to the `jate` object store in `IndexedDB`. This method overwrites the existing content under a specific `id`.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `content` (string): The text content to be saved.
  
### `getDb()`

- **Description**: Retrieves all the content stored in the `jate` object store in `IndexedDB`. If no content exists, it will return `null`.
- **Returns**: 
  - The stored content or `null` if no data is available.

## Service Worker

The service worker is automatically registered using Workbox. It enables caching of static assets and provides offline capabilities, making the app accessible even when there is no network connection.
